        <h1>Iodoku Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 9, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Developer:</strong> David Seppi</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Overview</h2>
    <p>Iodoku is a Sudoku game. We designed it to be used without collecting any personal data from you. We don't create accounts, we don't use analytics, and we don't track you across apps or websites.</p>

    <h2>2) Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy explains how Iodoku handles information on iOS/iPadOS. If we ever change the App to handle data differently, we'll update this policy and App Store disclosures first.</p>

    <h2>3) What we do not collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or process any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contact Information (e.g., name, email, phone)</li>
        <li>Location Data (precise or coarse)</li>
        <li>Identifiers (e.g., advertising ID, device ID)</li>
        <li>Health, Fitness, or Sensitive Information</li>
        <li>Financial Information or Payment Details</li>
        <li>Contacts, Photos, Camera, Microphone, Files & Docs</li>
        <li>User Content (e.g., text, images, audio)</li>
        <li>Browsing or Search History</li>
        <li>Usage Data or Product Interaction Analytics</li>
        <li>Diagnostics or Crash Logs (from our own systems)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also do not share or sell data, and we do not link any data to your identity.</p>

    <h2>4) On-device data (non-personal)</h2>
    <p>To make the game work, the App may store small pieces of non-personal data locally on your device (for example: current puzzle state, difficulty preferences, and UI settings). This data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>stays on your device,</li>
        <li>is not transmitted to us, and</li>
        <li>can be deleted by removing the app or resetting the app data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) App permissions</h2>
    <p>Iodoku does not request access to device features like Contacts, Photos, Camera, Microphone, or Location.</p>

    <h2>6) Third-party services & Apple frameworks</h2>
    <p><strong>App Store & Apple:</strong> You obtain Iodoku through Apple's App Store. Apple may process limited device or purchase information to deliver the app, manage updates, handle payments, prevent fraud, or support Family Sharing. That processing is covered by Apple's privacy policies—not ours.</p>
    <p><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> If present, payments are processed by Apple. We do not receive your payment details.</p>
    <p>We do not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>

    <h2>7) "Privacy Nutrition Label" (App Store Connect)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Data Not Collected</li>
        <li><strong>Data Linked to You:</strong> No</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> No tracking across apps or websites owned by other companies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Apple may independently collect crash reports or diagnostics if you've opted into Share with App Developers at the system level. We do not receive any data that identifies you.</p>

    <h2>8) Children's privacy</h2>
    <p>Iodoku can be used by people of all ages. Because we do not collect personal data, the App complies with children's privacy requirements (e.g., COPPA) on a no-collection basis.</p>

    <h2>9) Security</h2>
    <p>Even though we don't collect personal data, we design the App with security best practices. Any on-device data is stored using standard iOS mechanisms and is removed when you uninstall the App.</p>

    <h2>10) International transfers</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or process personal data; therefore, we do not transfer personal data internationally.</p>

    <h2>11) Your rights</h2>
    <p>Because we don't collect personal data, there is nothing for us to access, correct, export, object to, or delete on our systems. If you have questions about Apple-managed data (e.g., purchases), please see Apple's privacy resources.</p>

    <h2>12) Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>If we ever introduce new features that require data, we will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>update this Privacy Policy,</li>
        <li>update our App Store "Privacy Nutrition Labels," and</li>
        <li>obtain consents where required by law, before new collection begins.</li>
    </ul>
